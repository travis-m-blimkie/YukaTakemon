## Objectives

This lesson will cover some basic functions that can be used to manipulate and analyze data in R. 

There are eight main functions we'll be talking about today, each allowing us to
manipulate data frames. These eight functions are:

* `glimpse()`  --  Take a peak at the structure and the first few row of the data
* `select()`  --  Choose columns (variables or attributes) from our data frame
* `%>%`  --  take the results from the left and push it to the right
* `filter()`  --  Choose rows (samples or observations) from our data frame
* `mutate()`  --  Create new columns
* `group_by()`  --  Group rows based on a particular value within that column
* `summarize()`  --  Perform some function on the grouped data
* `left_join()` -- Combine two tables based on a shared column

Here we go! 

## Setup

If you haven't already, make sure you have `tidyverse` and `gapminder` installed and loaded with the following commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Download the packages in to our personal library
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gapminder"))

# Load the packages for use
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

We're going to use the `gapminder` data set to apply our knowledge of functions. Before we use their data, let's quickly learn about the data set:

> Gapminder Foundation is a non-profit venture registered in Stockholm, Sweden, that promotes sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels. [[1]](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/our-mission/)

## glimpse()

Let's take a quick look at our data frame to remind ourselves of its structure. We do this using the `glimpse()` command, which will display the structure and the first few rows of our data frame.

```{r}
glimpse(gapminder)
```

**What do you observe?**

* Number of rows and columns
* Name of columns
* Content of columns
* Type of data in the columns

#### <span style="color: lightgreen;">Quick side note on tibbles and data frames</span>
In R, one of the main types of objects/variables we're going to be working with is a **data frame**. This is much like a table you would view in Excel, where column represent variables or measures and rows represent measurements, samples, or observations.

#### <span style="color: lightgreen;">Quick side note on loading and saving data</span>

We cheated by loading our data using the `gapminder` packages. Normally we would need to **read in** and **write out** data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Write data out as comma separated file
write_csv(gapminder, "~/my_project/data/gapminder.csv")

# Read .csv file in
write_csv(gapminder, "~/my_project/data/gapminder.csv")

# other formats include .tsv or any defined separator
```

***

## Choose Columns: select

The first function we'll be using is `select()`. This function let's us pick columns from our data frame, based on name (e.g. year) or by index (e.g. 3).

<img src = "https://github.com/ytakemon/YukaTakemon/blob/master/static/img/DataJam2020/select_image.png?raw=true"/>

Let's try using `select()` to pick out a few columns: "country", "year", "lifeExp", and "pop". We'll be assigning these columns to a new data frame,`gapminder_select`. Then we'll use `glimpse()` to see if it worked.

```{r}
# select() code here
gapminder_select <- select(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp, pop)

# Check the data frame
glimpse(gapminder_select)
```

As you can see, our new data frame contains only a subset of the columns from the original data frame, based on the names we provided in the `select()` command.

## Pipe: %>%

The pipe symbol `%>%` sends or "pipes" an object (e.g. a data frame like gapminder) INTO a function (e.g. `select()`).

So, the above `select()` command can be rewritten as follows (NOTE: the "." is a placeholder, which represents the object being piped). Again, we can check our result using `head()`.

```{r}
# select() using pipe syntax
gapminder_pipe <- gapminder %>% 
  select(., country, year, lifeExp, pop)

glimpse(gapminder_pipe)
```

We can actually simplify the above command further - dplyr's functions such as `select()` are smart enough that you don't actually need to include the "." placeholder, as shown below.

```{r}
# select() using pipe syntax w/out a placeholder
gapminder_pipe2 <- gapminder %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp, pop)

head(gapminder_pipe2)
```

### <span style="color: darkorange;">Challenge 1:</span> (5 mins)

Reorder the code below to create a code that uses `select()` command and pipe (` %>% `) notation to pick the columns `continent`, `GDP per capita`, `life expectancy`, and `year` from the `gapminder` data frame. Then assign them to a new variable `result`, and display the results using `glimpse()`. 

A) `glimpse(result)`
B) `result <-`
C) `select(continent, gdpPercap, lifeExp, year)`
D) `%>%`
E) `gapminder`

***

## Choose Rows: filter

So we've covered selecting columns, but what about rows? This is where `filter()` comes in. This function allows us to choose rows from our data frame using some logical criteria. An example is filtering for rows in which the country is Canada. This can also be applied to numerical values, such as the
year being equal to 1967, or life expectancy greater than 30.

NOTE: In R, equality (e.g. country is Canada, year is 1967) is done using a double equals sign (`==`).

<img src = "https://github.com/ytakemon/YukaTakemon/blob/master/static/img/DataJam2020/filter_image.png?raw=true"/>

Let's go through a couple examples.

```{r}
# Filter rows where country is Canada
gapminder_canada <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada")

head(gapminder_canada)
```

Let's try another one, this time filtering on life expectancy above a certain
threshold:

```{r}
# Filter for rows where life expectancy is greater than 50
gapminder_LE <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(lifeExp > 50)

head(gapminder_LE)
```

We can also filter with multiple arguments, each separated by a comma:

```{r}
# filter() for Canada and life expectancy greater than 80
gapminder_C_LE <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada", lifeExp > 80)

head(gapminder_C_LE)
```

### <span style="color: darkorange;">Challenge 2:</span> (5 mins)

Choose the code(s) the will produce the correct answer for the task below: 

Use `filter()` to choose data for all African countries, from the year 1982 and onwards and assign them to a variable called `gapminder_africa`. Hint: `>=` is used for the greater than or equal to symbol.

**A)**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_africa <- filter(., continent == "Africa", year >= 1982)
```

**B)**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_africa <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa", year >= 1982)
```

**C)**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_africa <- filter(gapminder, continent == "Africa") %>%
  filter(year > 1982)
```

**D)**
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_africa <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Africa" & year >= 1982)
```

Can you explain why some of them didn't work?

***

## Create New Columns: mutate()

Let's say we now want to calculate the total GDP, which is done by mutiplying the GDP per capita by the population. `mutate()` will perform this calculation on each row in the data frame, one row at a time (i.e. row-wise). 

```{r}
# Use mutate() to calculate GDP in billions
gapminder_totalgdp <- gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp_total = gdpPercap * pop)

head(gapminder_totalgdp)
```

### Combine Functions with Pipes

We've seen that pipes ( **%>%** ) can be used to send an object such as a data frame into a function, such as `select()`, or `filter()`. But they can also be used to send the output of one function into another function. This allows us to chain together multiple commmands, without the need for intermediate variables.

Let's take a look at this in an example.

```{r}
# select() the five columns, and filter() for Canada
gapminder_multi <- gapminder %>%
    select(country, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap) %>%
    filter(country == "Canada")

head(gapminder_multi)
```

We can further expand on this by incorporating our `mutate()` command from earlier, linking multiple functions into a single command. 

### <span style="color: darkorange;">Challenge 3:</span> (5 mins)

`select()` all columns except for `continent` and `filter()` to show only data from Canada. Then calculate the total gdp for each row and place it into a new column named `gdp_total`.

Hint: Instead of selecting the columns you want, you can also subtract the columns you don't want with `-`. eg `-year`

***

## Calculations with group_by and summarise

These functions allow us to work on our data in specific groups. For example, we can use `group_by()` to group observations by country, then calculate the maximum, minimum, and average life expectancy for each country.

<img src = "https://github.com/ytakemon/YukaTakemon/blob/master/static/img/DataJam2020/groupby_summarize_image.png?raw=true"/>

```{r}
# group_by() country, calculate average life expectancy
gapminder %>%
group_by(country) %>%
summarise(LifeExp_ang = max(lifeExp),
          LifeExp_ang = min(lifeExp),
          LifeExp_ang = mean(lifeExp))
```
>**Extra:** `group_by()` can be combined with `tally()`to count all the rows corresponding to that group.
>```
>gapminder %>% group_by(continent, year) %>% tally()
>```

## Combining tables with _join()

Let's say you have two data frames that you want to combine. Both data frames contain a column with unique identifiers, but each data frame may contain different columns of information. That's where join functions come in!

There are a variety of ways data can be joined. Here are a few common ones you may come across:
<img src = "https://github.com/ytakemon/YukaTakemon/blob/master/static/img/Common_joins-01.png?raw=true"/>

### left_join()

The `left_join()` function takes one data frame on the "left" and using a specified column, looks for matching entries on the "right". Note that the output data frame will contain all rows
and columns from the left dataframe, as well as all columns from right, but only matching rows from.

<img src = "https://github.com/ytakemon/YukaTakemon/blob/master/static/img/DataJam2020/leftjoin_image.png?raw=true"/>

First let's load some simple example data to play with:
```{r left_join_ex}
band_members

band_instruments
```
Now we can use `left_join()` to combine the two tables, based on matching values in a specified column. The syntax is as follows:

```{r left_join}
left_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```
### right_join()

`right_join()` works exactly the same with and you can also specify which column you wish to join by to get the same results

```{r right_join}
right_join(band_members, band_instruments, by = "name")
```
>**Extra:** Note that you can have different column names in each of your data frames, and still join the tables together. The syntax for this is:
>```
>left_join(x, y, by = c("columnX" = "columnY"))
>```

### <span style="color: darkorange;">Challenge 4: Tying it all together</span> (10 mins)

Now let's use all the commands we've covered and combine them with pipes into a single statement.

Calculate the mean and standard deviation (`sd()`) of the total GDP for all counties in Asia from 1990 and onwards.

    summarise(totalGDP_mean = mean(totalGDP), 
              totalGDP_sd = sd(totalGDP))
```
